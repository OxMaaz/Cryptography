for eg alice wanna send 1 eth to bob

1.Alice would take bobs public key encrypt the message in it
2.Alice would sign the message by his private key making a digital signature
3.Bob would verify the signature by taking alice public key is this message be signed by alice or not

If Alice wants to send 1 ETH to Bob, she would need to create a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. 
This transaction would include the following information:

The amount of ETH being sent (in this case, 1 ETH)
The recipient's public address (in this case, Bob's public address)
Any additional information, such as a message or memo
Once Alice has created the transaction, she would need to sign it with her private key. This is done using a
 process called digital signing. Digital signing is a cryptographic technique that uses a hash function to create
  a unique digital signature based on the data in the transaction and the private key.

The digital signature is then included in the transaction along with the other information. When Bob receives the
transaction, he can use Alice's public key to verify the digital signature and ensure that the transaction was 
signed by Alice and that the transaction has not been tampered with.

So to summarize, in a cryptocurrency transaction, digital signing is used to ensure the authenticity of the 
transaction and verify the identity of the sender. The process involves creating a digital signature based on the
transaction data and the sender's private key, and then verifying the signature using the sender's public key.
